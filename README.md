# MEMORY-MANAGEMENT-PROJECT
•	Developed memory management algorithms using segmentation technic.

•	Created GUI using C++ QT framework to visualize the memory allocation and deallocation using graphics view and the segmentation table. 



#  Background
## What is the function of memory management?
The memory management function In operating systems is to keep track o  the status either allocated or free. When memory is going to be allocated it determines where it should be allocated. It has all the memory (free and allocated) and tracks its status frequently.
The memory management system provides:
1.	Large Address Space
2.	Protection
3.	Memory Mapping
4.	Physical Memory Allocation for Processes
5.	Shared Virtual Memory
